# Software-Fault-classification-using-NN
here i have done software fault classification as faulty or not-faulty using neural network. Dataset is downloaded from Promise data repository, which is a famous bug data repository. You can try with different datasets from eclipse nad nasa data repository. I have also added 2 dropout layers to deal with overfitting.
Enhancements:
  use CNN and DBN for the same
  use new datasets
